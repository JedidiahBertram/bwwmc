### Description

Walk into the dog food aisle at your local grocery or pet store and you
are instantly surrounded by towering walls shelving a veritable smorgasbord of
dog foods. Brands, types, the options are pretty overwhelming.

The only issue? None are very good.

Or as Toby Godfrey put it, "They're all garbage. You're feeding your dog garbage."

Enter Bow Wow Where's My Chow.

Not only does it eliminate the need to get a whiff of the wonderful aroma of the
dog food aisle (or possibly a trip to the store all together) through a convenient
delivery system, but it provides dogs and their owners a healthy, organic alternative to the big brand name dog foods.

Putting you, and your dogs bowels at ease. You're life may have never been so
melanCOLLIE. ;)
